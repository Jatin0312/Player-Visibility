# Player Visibility
Let other players vanish with just one simple click!

### How does it work?
This plugin lets you define worlds where players can use items or commands to hide other players. When hidden players are no longer rendered on the client, which help save some precious computing power.

### Customisable?
Both the Bukkit and Sponge version of the plugin share a nearly the same configuration file. Only the format is different (YML for Bukkit and HOCON for Sponge).  
Within that same configuration file you can edit messages, items, cooldown, etc. The Sponge version is able to both use modded items (using Forge) and vanilla items, where Bukkit can only use vanilla items.  

### Download?
I try to share as much code as possible between the Bukkit and Sponge version. Individual downloads are aviable through their respective download providers.
